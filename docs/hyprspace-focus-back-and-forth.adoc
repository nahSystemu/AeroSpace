{manpurpose}.
The element is either a window or an empty workspace.

HyprSpace stores only one previously focused window in history,
which means that if you close the previous window,
`focus-back-and-forth` has no window to switch focus to.
In that case, the command will exit with non-zero exit code.

That's why it may be preferred to combine `focus-back-and-forth` with `workspace-back-and-forth`: +
----
hyprspace focus-back-and-forth || hyprspace workspace-back-and-forth
